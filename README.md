## Notes

* I had trouble with keeping all cards the same width. I fixed it by setting min-width and max-width for each one of them
* When the screen is resized, the table would just overflow outside of the screen. I fixed it by decreasing the width of cards at each breakpoint.
* All pictures, including the background cover, are taken from various online resources. I did a Google search and copied the direct links to images I found.
